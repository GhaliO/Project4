    <h2>Downloading Your Programming Platform</h2>
    <p>Visual Studio Code is a source code editor and a platform that will allow you to code in programming languages like HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p><strong>Download Visual Studio Code:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open your browser and go to the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">official Visual Studio Code website</a>.</li>
      <li>Choose your version for your operating system. Your operating system is either Windows, macOS, or Linux.</li>
      <li>Simply click on the download button for your operating system.</li>
      <li>Follow the instructions for a step-by-step guide to complete the installation process.</li>
      <li>Once the installation has completed, open Visual Studio Code!</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Using Visual Studio Code</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Creating and Managing Projects:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open VS Code and click on the "Create a new project" button to open your project folder.</li>
      <li>Select the framework type you will be using and the programming language.</li>
      <li>Then click “Next” and enter your project name location directory.</li>
      <li>Finally, select your target framework and click on “Create”. (The framework is just the prebuilt in code that helps you structure your code instead of starting from scratch) </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This will direct you to the source code page where you will write your code. Make sure to head over to the right panel of your project, right-click, and add HTML source code and then CSS source code. This will create two code sources that you will use for your website.</p>
    <div class="caution-section">
      <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Different programming languages may have specific naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and files. Following these conventions ensures that your code is functional and easily understood.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="warning-section">
      <p><strong>Warning Notice!</strong> Before you start programming, it is important to be aware of the potential data loss that you may encounter. Programmers have to be extra careful about taking the appropriate measures to protect their work. Follow these precautions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Backup Your Files:</strong><br>Regularly back up your project files to prevent data loss in case of unexpected events.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-save Settings:</strong><br>Configure your code editor to auto-save files at regular intervals to minimize the risk of losing unsaved changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Offline Editing:</strong><br>If possible, avoid editing critical files while offline to prevent conflicts and data loss when syncing.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p>Here is a YouTube video that will guide you through the installation process: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSH21p8MPSg&ab_channel=NobleDesktop" target="_blank">Watch Now</a></p>

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>Congrats, now that you have set up your programming platform, we can move on to the basics of HTML! You can use Virtual Studio Code to code in many other programming languages as you progress in your coding journey. Check out the <a href="HTMLBasics.html">HTML Basics</a> page to get started with creating the structure of your web pages.</p>
